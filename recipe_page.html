        <!-- Paragraphs with Styling -->
        <p>Pancakes are a <em>delicious</em> and <b>versatile</b> dish enjoyed around the world. They can be served as a <mark>sweet</mark> breakfast or a savory meal, depending on the toppings and ingredients used.</p>
        <p>Historically, pancakes date back to ancient times and were often made with simple ingredients like <u>flour</u>, water, and eggs. Today, recipes have evolved to include a variety of <strong>flavors</strong> and textures.</p>
        <p>The <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> is known for its fluffy pancakes, often served with maple syrup and butter. In contrast, French crêpes are thin and delicate, ideal for both sweet and savory fillings.</p>
        <p>To achieve the perfect pancake, it’s important to measure your ingredients accurately and mix the batter until just combined. Overmixing can lead to <small>dense</small> and rubbery pancakes.</p>
        <p>Cooking pancakes requires a well-heated skillet. A drop of water should <b>sizzle</b> when it hits the surface, indicating the correct temperature.</p>
        <p>Finally, pancakes are best enjoyed fresh off the griddle. Serve them with your favorite toppings like fresh fruit, whipped cream, or <u>chocolate syrup</u>.</p>
